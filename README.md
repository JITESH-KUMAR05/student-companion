Student Companion üßë‚Äçüéì
Student Companion is a full-stack web application designed as a personal dashboard for students to organize their academic and personal lives. Built with Flask and MongoDB, this app integrates an AI companion to provide intelligent, context-aware assistance. This project was developed as a comprehensive mini-project.

‚ú® Features
The application is split into a full-featured user mode and a secure admin panel.

User Features
Secure Authentication: Robust user registration and login system with password hashing.

Dynamic Dashboard: A central hub that provides an at-a-glance view of urgent tasks, recent notes, and a motivating summary of the user's progress generated by the AI.

Smart Task Manager: Users can create, complete, and delete tasks. Each task can be assigned a High, Medium, or Low priority level, and the list is automatically sorted by importance.

Notes System with Attachments: A dedicated page to create, view, and manage notes. Users can attach files to their notes by providing a shareable link from services like Google Drive.

Personal Diary: A private, chronological journal for personal reflections and thoughts.

Context-Aware AI Companion: An interactive chat page where an AI assistant (powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model) can answer questions. The AI uses the student's own notes, tasks, and recent diary entries as context (RAG) to provide highly personalized and relevant answers.

Administrator Features
Secure Admin Panel: A protected dashboard accessible only to the designated admin user.

Application Analytics: The admin dashboard displays key statistics, including the total number of users, tasks, notes, and diary entries in the database.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Backend: Python with the Flask framework.

Database: MongoDB (hosted on MongoDB Atlas).

AI Model: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash via the Google AI Python SDK.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Jinja2 for templating).

Core Python Libraries:

Flask-Login for session management.

PyMongo for database interaction.

python-dotenv for managing environment variables.

Werkzeug for password hashing.
